Compilation:
    The Makefile for this project will create the following:
        bin/oss
        bin/user
    
        The default recipe 'make' will build both of these executables.
        'make clean' will delete obj/ and bin/, including all files within
        'make cleanrun' will delete bin/*.out and bin/*.log

Running the program:
        oss can be run with any runpath. bin/oss is a valid directive
        oss [OPTIONS]

        -h  : Display a MAN-Page style help message
