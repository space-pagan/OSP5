Compilation:
    The Makefile for this project will create the following:
        bin/oss
        bin/user
    
        The default recipe 'make' will build both of these executables.
        'make clean' will delete obj/ and bin/, including all files within
        'make cleanrun' will delete bin/*.out and bin/*.log

Running the program:
    This program takes one optional command-line argument, -v:

        oss [-v]

        -v  : Set logging to verbose mode. An absence of this flag will
              automatically set logging to non-verbose mode.

Version Control:
    This project's version control has been managed under git. For a log of
    modifications, use 'git log', and its various options.

Outstanding Problems:
    None, to my knowledge

Encountered Difficulties:
    None worth mentioning

Bugtesting efforts:
    Running oss and looking at the log to make sure everything makes sense
